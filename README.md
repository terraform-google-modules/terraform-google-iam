# Google IAM Terraform Module

This is a collection of submodules that make it easier to non-destructively manage multiple IAM roles for resources on Google Cloud Platform:
* [Folders IAM](modules/folders_iam)
* [KMS Crypto Keys IAM](modules/kms_crypto_keys_iam)
* [KMS_Key Rings IAM](modules/kms_key_rings_iam)
* [Organizations IAM](modules/organizations_iam)
* [Projects IAM](modules/projects_iam)
* [Pubsub Subscriptions IAM](modules/pubsub_subscriptions_iam)
* [Pubsub Topics IAM](modules/pubsub_topics_iam)
* [Service Accounts IAM](modules/service_accounts_iam)
* [Storage Buckets IAM](modules/storage_buckets_iam)
* [Subnets IAM](modules/subnets_iam)

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12. If you haven't
[upgraded][terraform-0.12-upgrade] and need a Terraform 0.11.x-compatible
version of this module, the last released version intended for Terraform 0.11.x
is [1.1.1][v1.1.1].

## Upgrading

The following guides are available to assist with upgrades:

- [4.0 -> 5.0](./docs/upgrading_to_iam_5.0.md)
- [3.0 -> 4.0](./docs/upgrading_to_iam_4.0.md)
- [2.0 -> 3.0](./docs/upgrading_to_iam_3.0.md)

## Usage

Full examples are in the [examples](./examples/) folder, but basic usage is as follows for managing roles on two projects:

```hcl
module "projects_iam_bindings" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/iam/google//modules/projects_iam"
  version = "~> 6.1"

  projects = ["project-123456", "project-9876543"]

  bindings = {
    "roles/storage.admin" = [
      "group:test_sa_group@lnescidev.com",
      "user:someone@google.com",
    ]

    "roles/compute.networkAdmin" = [
      "group:test_sa_group@lnescidev.com",
      "user:someone@google.com",
    ]

    "roles/compute.imageUser" = [
      "user:someone@google.com",
    ]
  }
}
```

The module also offers an **authoritative** mode which will remove all roles not assigned through Terraform. This is an example of using the authoritative mode to manage access to a storage bucket:

```hcl
module "storage_buckets_iam_bindings" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/iam/google//modules/storage_buckets_iam"
  version = "~> 5.0"

  storage_buckets = ["my-storage-bucket"]

  mode = "authoritative"

  bindings = {
    "roles/storage.legacyBucketReader" = [
      "user:josemanuelt@google.com",
      "group:test_sa_group@lnescidev.com",
    ]

    "roles/storage.legacyBucketWriter" = [
      "user:josemanuelt@google.com",
      "group:test_sa_group@lnescidev.com",
    ]
  }
}
```

### Additive and Authoritative Modes

The `mode` variable controls a submodule's behavior, by default it's set to "additive", possible options are:

  - additive: add members to role, old members are not deleted from this role.
  - authoritative: set the role's members (including removing any not listed), unlisted roles are not affected.

In authoritative mode, a submodule takes full control over the IAM bindings listed in the module. This means that any members added to roles outside the module will be removed the next time Terraform runs. However, roles not listed in the module will be unaffected.

In additive mode, a submodule leaves existing bindings unaffected. Instead, any members listed in the module will be added to the existing set of IAM bindings. However, members listed in the module *are* fully controlled by the module. This means that if you add a binding via the module and later remove it, the module will correctly handle removing the role binding.

## Caveats

### Referencing values/attributes from other resources

Each submodule performs operations over some variables before making any changes on the IAM bindings in GCP. Because of the limitations of `for_each` ([more info](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#using-expressions-in-for_each)), which is widely used in the submodules, there are certain limitations to what kind of dynamic values you can provide to a submodule:

1. Dynamic entities (for example `projects`) are only allowed for 1 entity.
2. If you pass 2 or more entities (for example `projects`), the configuration **MUST** be static, meaning that it can't use any of the other resources' fields to get the entity name from (this includes getting the randomly generated hashes through the `random_id` resource).
3. The role names themselves can never be dynamic.
4. Members may only be dynamic in `authoritative` mode.

## IAM Bindings

You can choose the following resource types to apply the IAM bindings:

- Projects (`projects` variable)
- Organizations(`organizations` variable)
- Folders (`folders` variable)
- Service Accounts (`service_accounts` variable)
- Subnetworks (`subnets` variable)
- Storage buckets (`storage_buckets` variable)
- Pubsub topics (`pubsub_topics` variable)
- Pubsub subscriptions (`pubsub_subscriptions` variable)
- Kms Key Rings (`kms_key_rings` variable)
- Kms Crypto Keys (`kms_crypto_keys` variable)

Set the specified variable on the module call to choose the resources to affect. Remember to set the `mode` [variable](#additive-and-authoritative-modes) and give enough [permissions](#permissions) to manage the selected resource as well. Note that the `bindings` variable accepts an empty map `{}` passed in as an argument in the case that resources don't have IAM bindings to apply.
